<h3>
What is Gentrification?
</h3>
    
<p>
Gentrification is when a low-income urban area is inavaded by wealthier people. The purpose of gentrification is to establish agriculture in the area and to attract large businesses.

<h3>
 My Experience Living in Bushwick    
</h3>
    
<p>
Growing up in Bushwick I’ve experienced the Hispanic culture surround me. However, as I got older, the further I walked from where I lived, the more I’ve seen family-owned businesses replaced by corporations. I’ve witnessed costly organic supermarkets replace affordable grocery stores. I’ve seen my neighbors evicted from their homes and left with nowhere to stay. As of right now, Bushwick is no longer the neighborhood of people of color, it is now a neighborhood of where POC work harder every day in order to not be evicted from wealthier people that are predominately white.     
</p>
    
<h3>
The Impact of Gentrification to POC </h3>
    
<p>
In 2020 reports, the residents of Bushwick are 19.6 percent black, 55.4 percent Hispanic and 17.5 percent white. It only took 17.5 percent of white people to cause the rise in eviction, the rise in rent/utilities, and the replacement of family-owned business to big corporations like Starbucks, Chipotle, expensive restaurants and coffee shops. 
</p>
    
<p>
 In the beginning of the 2000’s, “According to census data, Bushwick saw a net in-migration of 9,155 non-Hispanic whites from 2000 to 2010, more than tripling the previous figures for the neighborhood. Meanwhile, after accounting for births and deaths, a net of 17,440 blacks and Hispanics moved out, nearly 16 percent of that population that lived in Bushwick in 2000.” This shows that the decline of POC began to rise in Bushwick when white people began to move into the area
</p>
    
<p>
In addition, encounters with the Police and POC residents of Bushwick increased when white residents move into the area. Researchers surveyed residents’ views and experiences with the NYPD, and it was proven that “arrests were three times more likely in lower-income communities of color after a high influx of white residents moved in to the neighborhood. Brooklyn areas that reflected this trend include Bushwick, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Crown Heights, Lefferts Gardens, and South Williamsburg.
